Define Fetchers and Processors

This part remains the same, defining interfaces and their implementations.

public interface IRecordFetcher
{
    Task<IEnumerable<Record>> FetchRecordsAsync();
}

public interface IRecordProcessor
{
    Task ProcessRecordAsync(Record record);
}

public class EmailFetcherA : IRecordFetcher
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Record>> FetchRecordsAsync()
    {
        // Fetch records based on condition A
    }
}

public class EmailProcessorA : IRecordProcessor
{
    public async Task ProcessRecordAsync(Record record)
    {
        // Process records and send email based on condition A
    }
}

public class EmailFetcherB : IRecordFetcher
{
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Record>> FetchRecordsAsync()
    {
        // Fetch records based on condition B
    }
}

public class EmailProcessorB : IRecordProcessor
{
    public async Task ProcessRecordAsync(Record record)
    {
        // Process records and send email based on condition B
    }
}

Create a Parallel Processing Manager

Implement a class that handles fetching and processing in parallel. For each fetcher, you will fetch records and process them concurrently.

public class ParallelProcessingManager
{
    private readonly IDictionary<Type, IRecordProcessor> _processorMap;

    public ParallelProcessingManager(IDictionary<Type, IRecordProcessor> processorMap)
    {
        _processorMap = processorMap;
    }

    public async Task ProcessAllAsync(IEnumerable<IRecordFetcher> fetchers)
    {
        // Start tasks for all fetchers
        var fetcherTasks = fetchers.Select(async fetcher =>
        {
            var records = await fetcher.FetchRecordsAsync();
            var processor = _processorMap[fetcher.GetType()];

            var processingTasks = records.Select(record => processor.ProcessRecordAsync(record));
            await Task.WhenAll(processingTasks);
        });

        // Await all fetcher tasks to complete
        await Task.WhenAll(fetcherTasks);
    }
}


Configure and Run

Configure the ParallelProcessingManager with your fetchers and processors, and execute them in parallel.

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create fetcher-processor mappings
        var processorMap = new Dictionary<Type, IRecordProcessor>
        {
            { typeof(EmailFetcherA), new EmailProcessorA() },
            { typeof(EmailFetcherB), new EmailProcessorB() }
        };

        var parallelProcessingManager = new ParallelProcessingManager(processorMap);

        // Define your fetchers
        var fetchers = new List<IRecordFetcher>
        {
            new EmailFetcherA(),
            new EmailFetcherB()
        };

        // Execute processing in parallel
        await parallelProcessingManager.ProcessAllAsync(fetchers);
    }
}


Explanation
ParallelProcessingManager:

ProcessAllAsync starts a task for each fetcher, fetching records and then processing them concurrently.
Each fetcher runs in parallel with its corresponding processor.
Fetching and Processing in Parallel:

The fetcherTasks list contains tasks for each fetcher. Each task fetches records and processes them in parallel.
Task.WhenAll(fetcherTasks) ensures that all fetcher tasks are awaited before completing the method.
Adding New Logic:

To add new fetching and processing logic, create new fetchers and processors, update the processorMap, and add new fetcher instances to the fetchers list.
By using this approach, you ensure that fetching and processing are handled in parallel, which improves efficiency and performance, especially if you have multiple fetchers and processors that can work independently.




The approach described here is a combination of a few design patterns and practices that enable parallel processing and extensibility. While there's no single pattern that encompasses everything, the following patterns and principles are involved:

*1. Pipeline Pattern
The Pipeline Pattern involves processing data through a sequence of stages or steps. In your case, fetching and processing records can be thought of as stages in a pipeline. Each stage (fetching and processing) can operate independently and in parallel.

*2. Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Here, fetchers and processors are interchangeable strategies that can be selected and applied as needed.

*3. Parallel Processing
This is more of a concurrency pattern than a specific design pattern. Parallel Processing involves executing multiple operations concurrently, which improves performance and efficiency. In your case, fetching and processing records in parallel is an example of this pattern.

*4. Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. In your example, you could use a factory to create fetcher and processor instances based on different conditions or configurations.

*5. Dependency Injection
Though not explicitly mentioned in the code, Dependency Injection (DI) is a design principle that helps manage dependencies between objects, making it easier to swap out implementations. In the provided example, DI can be used to inject the appropriate fetchers and processors into the ProcessingManager or ParallelProcessingManager.

Combining Patterns
In your scenario, these patterns and practices are combined to achieve the desired outcome:

Pipeline Pattern: Processing records through a sequence of fetcher and processor stages.
Strategy Pattern: Using different fetchers and processors as interchangeable strategies.
Parallel Processing: Running multiple fetchers and processors concurrently.
Factory Pattern: Optionally used to create fetchers and processors dynamically.
Dependency Injection: Used to manage dependencies and enhance testability.
Summary
While the combination of these patterns and practices doesn't have a specific name, they collectively form a robust approach for handling parallel processing with extensible fetchers and processors. This design allows you to efficiently manage and scale your processing logic as requirements evolve.
